    "## Introduction\n",
    "The COVID-19 virus is an incisive event in the 21st century. Nearly all countries in the world are affected and the effects are noticeable on a macroscopic level for countries, provinces and cities and on a microscopic level for individuals. From its origin in the Chinese province of Wuhan the virus spread all over the world. The question is what effects and what extensions of the effects are to be anticipated by countries, regions and individuals that have not experienced the full possible extend of the virus. Data Science can give answers to those questions on the basis of data that has been collected in regions close to the origin of the virus."
